# Gems
A minecraft plugin for my server

the comamnd revolves around awarding players with gems for claiming chat messages or killing other players.
the gems serve no real purpose in game other than for trading. it was just a random idea me and my friends came up with for our minecraft server.

if you want to use this for some reason, i may have a jar file attached in the release section, if no then use Intelij to compile to jar for a server.


## commands:
`/forceevent` forces a gem chat message (requires op)

`/claim <code>` claims a gem package

`/displaycodes` displays all active codes (requires op)
